Method Over-Loading:-

-When a Class have more than 1 method
-Same Name methods,
-with multiple Behaviours/ Signature (parameters, sequence of parameter, no. of parameters)
-Example of Polymorphism
-Compile Time Polymorphism

Advantages:

-Same name can be used by a program, not to remember too many names of methods
-using indexes we can search n number of characters.
-using different signature of parameters we can use the same name for multiple methods
