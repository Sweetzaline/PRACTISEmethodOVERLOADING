Method Over-Loading:-

-When a Class have more than 1 method
-Same Name methods,
-with multiple Behaviours/ Signature (parameters, sequence of parameter, no. of parameters)
-Example of Polymorphism
-Compile Time Polymorphism
-OL is about defining multiple behaviors to a method.
-We can define Multiple methods with same name by changing the parameters.
-Can be performed within same class as well as in parent-child classes also.
-Child class doesn’t need to take permission from the parent class for method overloading.
-No keyword to create Over-Loading
-Occurs in a class
-Static & Private methods can be OL because both are class members.
-Return type- can or can’t be same, different parameters
-Compile-time Polymorphism


Advantages:

-Same name can be used by a program, not to remember too many names of methods
-using indexes we can search n number of characters.
-using different signature of parameters we can use the same name for multiple methods
